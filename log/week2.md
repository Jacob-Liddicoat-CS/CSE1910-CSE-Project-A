# Log Message for Major Project for Week 2
## What was your goal for the past week?
The goal was to make a strong AI opponent using the minimax algorithm. The main challenge was where and how to implement the minimax algorithm into my existing code for the tic tac toe game.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I did not. The reason was implementing the AI would be harder and take longer than expected. I also had to fix other errors with the code. I was able to fix one syntax error where i forgot to put a "}" at the end of the code. However I could not fix the other errors including how to fix another syntax error and change turns. I also need to get the game to work properly. I also wasn't able to get to the AI because when I was trying to solve the errors in the game I often was able able to implemement it and/or it caused more errors to pop up.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned how to fix one syntax error and learned that I can not implement the AI.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to fix the two errors. One being a syntax error like this. TicTacToe.java:3: error: '{' expected
public class Tic-Tac-Toe. Another was to be able to change turns and fix any other errors so that the game at least works properly. 
                ^
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
My main challenges is if I am able to solve the errors in a short amount of time in class.
